# LazyFP PoC
This proof-of-concept has been made as a Bachelor's degree thesis work.

The exploit is based on [@paboldin meltdown-exploit](https://github.com/paboldin/meltdown-exploit) repository for the Flush+Reload implementation.

Look at the original paper for details: [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07480.pdf)

Thanks to [Julian Stecklina](https://twitter.com/blitzclone) for the help in developing the PoC!
